# Captioneer
Simple python script to generate backgrounds from a set of small caption images

This is a simple project of mine that I wrote a while ago when I was learning python. I'm a fan of
the game *Antichamber*, and the quotes and images that you discover in that game as you progress.
Each quote and image relates somehow to a puzzle in that game, and gives quite useful advice for
solving problems in general.

So I wanted those images and captiopns to be randomly generated on my phone. I couldn't find an
application to do thiws easily, so I tried having a go on my own.

I loaded all the images generated into `TODO/path/on/anfdoid` and used the app `TODO
name_of_app_and_maybe_link` to do this.
